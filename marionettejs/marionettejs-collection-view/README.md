### MarionetteJS Collection View 

After contributing to this awesome set of [Backbone Tutorials](https://github.com/thomasdavis/backbonetutorials), I've realized that I enjoy writing/editing tutorials so much that I've decided it's time branch out of my own and do a bit of piracy in the process. I've swiped his first beginner tutorial and levelled it up a bit.   

I've completely refactored the base Backone views into more specific MarionetteJS Item and Collection Views; applied the RequireJS module loading approach; and, within the ItemView,  there is a little D3 icon experiment.

If an app is built with vector graphics, you should have little worry about how they will respond to different resolutions; the only fear is browsers older than IE9, but they can be backed up with raster fallbacks.
